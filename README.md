# WBSEditor
An editor for a Website Builder Script I made.

## Compiling

In the project directory run `qmake WBSProj.pro` and then `make`, this will generate the `wbsedit` executable. You will need `qt6-base` installed.
### Windows
First regret your life choices, then run `qmake WBSProj.pro` and then use cmake to generate the executable. You will need qt v6 installed.
